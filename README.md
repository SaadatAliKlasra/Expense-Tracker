<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project
### Homepage
[![Expense Tracker Homepage Screenshot][homepage-screenshot]]
This is the homepage which lists out all the added expenses in the database. Even though I've not added any database, but I've stored all the expenses values in a variable which can be stored in to any database using api (or any other database that you want)

### Add Expense
[![Expense Tracker Add Expense Screenshot][add-expense-screenshot]]
After clicking on Add New Expense button, you will endup seeing a new form to add a new expense which you can see in the screenshot. Here you can set the title, price, and also date for that specific expense.
