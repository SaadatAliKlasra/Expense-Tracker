<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project
### Homepage
![Expense Tracker Homepage Screenshot][homepage-screenshot] </br>
This is the homepage that lists out all the added expenses in the database. Even though I've not added any database, I've stored all the expenses values in a variable that can be stored into any database using API (or any other database that you want) </br>

### Add Expense
![Expense Tracker Add Expense Screenshot][add-expense-screenshot] </br>
After clicking on Add New Expense button, you will end up seeing a new form to add a new expense which you can see in the screenshot. Here you can set the title, price, and also date for that specific expense.
